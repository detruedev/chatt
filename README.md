# Chatt

This is a lifetime app. I'd like to make it so that people can chat. It'll be linked to a SNS that will be built on RoR.

Contributions are always welcome! If you want to collaborate, whether that is with a new feature or fixing a bug, we recommend you...

* If it's a new issue/feature, or no one is working on it already, fork the project in GitHub (you'll need an account if you don't have it yet).
* Create the bug to let us know you want to work on this. That way we are aware of and can keep an eye on it, or maybe tell you that it is not a bug but an intended feature, and save you the hassle of working on something that is not needed.
* Do the changes you deem necessary
* Commit or Contact us.
